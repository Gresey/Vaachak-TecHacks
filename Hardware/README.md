## Respeaker Pi-Hat
ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT is a dual-microphone expansion board for Raspberry Pi designed for AI and voice applications. This means that you can build a more powerful and flexible voice product that integrates Amazon Alexa Voice Service, Google Assistant, and so on.

## Feature

Voice User Int	rface for Raspberry Pi Series: Placed by 4 analogue microphones, which come with the Voice Interaction algorithms of VAD(Voice Activity Detection), DOA(Direction of Arrival), KWS(Key Word Spotting)
WM8960 Audio Codec: Low power, high-quality stereo Codec designed for portable digital audio applications
Controllable Peripherals: Provide 3 programable APA102 RGB LEDs and 1 User Button for attached Speech Recognition usage
Easy Assembly: Simply pop up on the Raspberry Pi to use


## Raspberry Pi 2W

Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is the latest product in our most affordable range of single-board
computers. The successor to the breakthrough Raspberry Pi Zero W, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
is a form factor–compatible drop-in replacement for the original board.
The board incorporates a quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU, clocked at 1GHz.
At its heart is a Raspberry Pi RP3A0 system-in-package (SiP), integrating a Broadcom
BCM2710A1 die with 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM. The upgraded processor provides
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with 40% more single-threaded performance, and five times more
multi-threaded performance, than the original single-core Raspberry Pi Zero

## Specification

Processor: Broadcom BCM2710A1, quad-core 64-bit SoC
(Arm Cortex-A53 @ 1GHz)
